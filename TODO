emesene2's todo:

e3:
- decide how preferences should work (program and protocol-related tabs?)
- consider adopting PIL (python image library) or strip some parts and adapt
  to emesene (so we can properly use gifs), or ctypes with libgif, or whatever
  (we need only resizing, so..)
- consider libisf for isf processing, or the good ol' python module 
  by mr. campbell we shipped with emesene1 (untested)

e3.xmpp:
- ?

e3.msn:
- decide if it's worth developing it, really

e3.papylib->upstream (eventually):
- find out what's wrong with papyon's sip calls module

gui:
- sanitize menues (emesene1 could be a good example)
- move to group, copy to group, etc.
- custom emoticon handling support (add, remove, save, use, etc.)
- audio/video settings and testing through gstreamer (with gtk gui?)

gui.gtk:
- investigate gedit's bars, they're nicer than our nicebar
  (but i don't know if it's already in pygtk)
  HOWEVER, if we're going to use our nicebar, we need to hax the FONT color too.
- port emesene1 preferences to emesene2 
  (and merge back plugins window in preferences)
